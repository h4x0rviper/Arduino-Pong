---HOW TO USE THIS SKETCH---

First of all, install the TVout library in your arduino IDE, and set up 
the circuitry needed by this library. You can find everything you need 
here: http://conde.google.com/arduino-tvout

Then you'll need two potentiometers to control the two platforms. 
Connect them as you would do with any potentiometer to pin A0 and A1. If 
you don't know how to do that, you can visit this site: 
http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Potentiometer
Or just look at the HARDWARE file ;)

Connect the RCA cable to your TV, select the appropriate AV input and 
enjoy!!
